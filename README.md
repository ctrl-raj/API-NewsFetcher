# API-NewsFetcher
The News API-Fetcher App is a simple yet functional desktop application built using Python and Tkinter, designed to fetch and display the latest news articles based on user input. It connects to the NewsAPI to retrieve real-time news headlines by keyword or topic, making it a great demonstration of working with APIs and GUI development.
